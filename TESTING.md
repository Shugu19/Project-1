# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

1. **Feature-by-Feature Testing:**
   - **Navigation:** Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
   - **Responsive Design:** Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
   - **Portfolio Display:** Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
   - **Contact Form:** Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.

2. **User Story Testing:**
   - **Usability Testing:** Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
   - **Accessibility Testing:** Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

3. **Compatibility Testing:**
   - **Browser Compatibility:** Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
   - **Device Compatibility:** Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).

4. **Documentation and Logs:**
   - Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
