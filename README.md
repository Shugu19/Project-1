# Project Overview: Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website â€“ a digital space where I showcase my skills, experiences, and creative projects. This project is more than just a website; it's a dynamic representation of who I am and what I bring to the table. Designed with a sleek and user-friendly interface, my portfolio aims to provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of my capabilities, making it a valuable resource for potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work.

## Project Goals:

1. **Showcasing Expertise:** The primary goal of my portfolio website is to present a detailed overview of my skills, ranging from technical proficiencies to creative talents. Through the 'About' section, visitors can gain insights into my background, education, and professional journey, creating a personal connection beyond the resume.

2. **Highlighting Services:** The 'Services' section is dedicated to outlining the specific services I offer. Whether it's web development, graphic design, content creation, or any other skill set, this section serves as a clear guide for potential clients or collaborators, allowing them to understand the range of services I provide.

3. **Portfolio Display:** The 'Portfolio' section serves as a visual gallery, showcasing a curated selection of my best work. Each project is presented with detailed descriptions, technologies used, and the challenges overcome, providing a deeper understanding of my abilities and creative approach.

4. **User-Friendly Experience:** The website is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, ensuring a seamless navigation experience for visitors. From the moment they land on the homepage to exploring individual projects, the user interface prioritizes ease of use, making it accessible to a diverse audience.

5. **Contact Section:** To encourage collaboration and networking, the 'Contact' section provides visitors with multiple avenues to connect with me. Whether it's for job opportunities, project inquiries, or just a friendly conversation, this section facilitates communication, fostering potential partnerships.

## Target Audience:

- **Employers and Recruiters:** The portfolio serves as a comprehensive resource for employers and recruiters to assess my skills, experience, and suitability for potential roles.
- **Clients and Collaborators:** Individuals or organizations seeking specific services can easily navigate the 'Services' and 'Portfolio' sections to evaluate my capabilities and determine if I'm the right fit for their project.

- **Peers and Networking Contacts:** The website is also a tool for connecting with fellow professionals, creatives, and like-minded individuals interested in collaboration, knowledge sharing, or networking opportunities.

In summary, my Personal Portfolio Website is more than just a collection of web pages; it's a strategic tool crafted to showcase my professional identity, connect with a diverse audience, and open doors to exciting opportunities. Explore the various sections to discover the skills, experiences, and projects that define me as a versatile and dedicated professional.

## UX

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #0f0e0e;
  --second-bg-color: #202020;
  --text-color: #fff;
  --second-text-color: #ccc;
  --main-color: #05b4ff;
  --big-font: 5rem;
  --h2-font: 3rem;
  --p-font: 1.1rem;
}
```

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;500;600;800;900&family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap);
  was used for the primary headers and titles and others.
